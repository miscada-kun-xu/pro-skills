## Documentation for new Interns
Provided by: Professional Skills Group5

Group members: Aihaiti Ailipaer, Kaihuai Zhang, Kaiming Xin, Kun Xu, Tingjie Cui
#### Introduction

This file will help you create a repository and manage the software build version, then test your software build and implement continuous integration (CI) for your repository.

The text below describes the work of Group 5 in the Professional Skills Code Development Coursework so that new interns could follow.


### 1. Git command and Github

**Needed: Github account, A bash shell with ssh, Git installed, Basic text editor**

Version control could help software developer manage their build much more easily. **Github** is a useful version control tool. It has benefits like **Version Tracking, Collaboration, and Remote Access**, also Github has integration with **Continuous Integration (CI)** for test running.

#### Common Git command
##### Setup and Init: 
<code>git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”</code> set name for credit.

<code>git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”</code> set email address associated with history maker.

<code>git init</code> initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.

<code>git clone [url]</code> clone entire repository from a hosted location.

<code>git status</code> shows the modified files in your working directory.

<code>git add [file]</code> add a specified file to the staging area.

<code>git commit -m “[descriptive message]”</code> submit file from staging area to repository.

##### Branch, Merge and Update
<code>git branch -a</code> list your branches.

<code>git checkout</code> switch to another branch.

<code>git merge [branch]</code> merge the specified branch’s history into the current one.

<code>git fetch [alias]</code> fetch the change in repository.

<code>git push [alias] [branch]</code> uploading a local branch to a remote repository.

<code>git pull [remote] [branch]</code> fetch changes from the remote repository and merge them with the local branch.
